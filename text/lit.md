# Anything related to our 'learning' algorithm?

Concept of 'observational learning'. But mostly applied to 'sequential' voting, not iterated elections with increasingly strategic voters.


A theory of fads, fashion, custom, and cultural change as
informational cascades. Bikhchandani (1992): 'cascade' behaviour: if I know that previous voters have co-ordinated on an outcome, I will do so too (simple up/down pure coordination game with sequential actions)

A simple model of herd behavior -- Banerjee (1992)

"Our departure is to allow an agent’s payoff to depend on the profile of actions of any subset of all agents—as opposed to only her own action—and, as usual, a binary state of the world." (p. 602)

"For instance, in a sequential electoral mechanism, an instrumentally motivated voter recognizes that her decision affects her payoff only when it changes the electoral outcome. Accordingly, she must account for both the informational content of being pivotal and that her vote could affect the way in which subsequent voters behave. Crucial to these considerations are her beliefs about the strategies followed by subsequent voters. [...]

Our main result is that **herding can emerge as the outcome of strategic behavior even when individuals have such forward-looking incentives**. The equilibrium we characterize, Sincere Behavior, takes a surprisingly simple and tractable form: each agent uses all currently available information—the prior, observed history of actions, and private signal—to form an expectation about the state and then selects her optimal action as if she only cares about her own action. In other words, sincere behavior is identical to how agents would behave if their payoffs were independent as in the standard framework. Consequently, as in the standard set- ting, this equilibrium generates a herd once the informational content of agents’ choices swamp the private information of any individual. Unlike the standard set- ting, however, optimality of sincere behavior in our model is genuinely a stra- tegic equilibrium phenomenon: if an agent does not expect future agents to act sincerely, then it typically would no longer be optimal for her to act sincerely either." 

--> something we haven't considered. Our voters aren't forward-looking in their strategic voting along the learning path.
